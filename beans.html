            <summary>Types of Coffee Beans</summary>
            <div class="stepContent">
                <h3>Arabica</h3>
                <p>Arabica beans are known for their smooth and complex flavor, often with fruity or floral notes. They are generally considered higher quality.</p>
                <h3>Robusta</h3>
                <p>Robusta beans are stronger and more bitter, with a more earthy flavor. They contain more caffeine and are often used in espresso blends.</p>

        <!-- Roast Levels -->
        <details>
            <summary>Roast Levels</summary>
            <div class="stepContent">
                <h3>Light Roast</h3>
                <p>Light roasts retain more of the beans' original flavors, often tasting fruity or floral. They are more acidic and have a lighter body.</p>
                <h3>Medium Roast</h3>
                <p>Medium roasts have a balanced flavor with a mix of acidity, sweetness, and body. This is the most common roast level.</p>
                <h3>Dark Roast</h3>
                <p>Dark roasts have a deep, smoky flavor. They are less acidic but have a heavier body and may taste bittersweet or chocolaty.</p>

        <!-- Grind Sizes -->
        <details>
            <summary>Grind Sizes</summary>
            <div class="stepContent">
                <h3>Coarse Grind</h3>
                <p>Best suited for French Press and cold brew. Coarse grounds allow for longer extraction times.</p>
                <h3>Medium Grind</h3>
                <p>Ideal for drip coffee makers and pour-over methods. Medium grind balances extraction and brew time.</p>
                <h3>Fine Grind</h3>
                <p>Perfect for AeroPress (with a short brew time) and Moka pot. Fine grinds provide quicker extraction.</p>
                <h3>Extra Fine Grind</h3>
                <p>Used for espresso machines. This grind allows for very quick extraction under high pressure.</p>
